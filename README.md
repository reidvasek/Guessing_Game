This game is rated E for everyone

I rehauled my game enabling it to utilize objects.

I regret to inform you that 'Guess that HObbit ' has been replaced with "Hobbit Vs. Troll"

In this game the hobbits need to defend the shire. The user selects a hobbit to fight the troll. The hobbits all have different properties which are hidden to the user. The user has to select the hobbit and then decide on a fight method to defeat the troll. The fight method also utilizes the properties of the object. Different hobbits with their different specialties will defeat the troll if you select the correct fight method.

Best of Luck!
